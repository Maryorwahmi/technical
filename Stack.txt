⚙️ My Forex Analyzer Tech Stack
Since my project involves real-time market data, multi-timeframe analysis, technical signal generation, and possibly automated execution, I’ve carefully chosen a stack that balances speed, flexibility, and long-term scalability.

🧱 1. Backend — Logic, Automation, and API Layer
🔧 Chosen Language: Python

Why I chose it:

Fast to prototype

Huge ecosystem for trading (TA-Lib, pandas-ta, MetaTrader5)

Ideal for data analysis, automation, and backtesting

Works seamlessly with APIs and schedulers

📚 Key Libraries & Tools I use:
Purpose	Tool
Technical Indicators	pandas-ta, TA-Lib, btalib
Multi-Timeframe Handling	pandas, numpy, SQLite or Postgres
Scheduling Tasks	APScheduler, Celery, cron
MT5 Integration	MetaTrader5 Python module
Backtesting (optional)	Backtrader, btgym, QuantConnect
Alerts / Notifications	Telegram Bot API, SMTP, discord.py
API Backend	FastAPI (preferred) or Flask

✅ Why I prefer FastAPI:
Fast and async — handles high-frequency updates well

Automatically generates Swagger UI docs

Clean, modern, and production-ready

Works great as a REST API provider for my frontend

🖥️ 2. Frontend — Signal Viewer, Controls, Logs
Depending on what I’m building — fast MVP or full-scale dashboard — I’m choosing between:

Option 1: 🟢 Streamlit (my choice for quick builds)
Pure Python = easy integration with backend logic

Great for visualizing signals, logs, charts, status panels

Zero frontend coding required

Can run locally or on a VPS

💽 3. Database — Signal History, Logs, Strategy Results
Purpose	Tool	Why I Use It
Local Dev/Test	SQLite	Simple and file-based — perfect for dev
Production Use	PostgreSQL	Robust, handles concurrency, good for REST APIs
Time-Series Data	InfluxDB (optional)	If I store large tick or candle sets

🤖 4. Trading Execution — Connecting to MetaTrader 5
My Options:
Approach	Tool	When I Use It
Direct Integration	MetaTrader5 Python API	When I want Python to control trades directly
EA Signal Receiver	Custom MQL5 EA + Webhook	If I want my analyzer external to MT5
Middleware Bridge	FastAPI + MQL5	If I need flexible command flow + logging

✅ My Preference:
I usually start with the MetaTrader5 Python module — it gives me access to both market data and order execution. But if I ever want to decouple, I’ll build a Python signal sender and an MQL5 EA receiver using webhooks or JSON.

🌐 5. Deployment — Hosting My Analyzer
Tool	Use Case
Ubuntu VPS	To host my backend, data pipeline, or dashboard
Docker	To containerize everything for easy redeploy
Nginx	As reverse proxy (FastAPI + frontend access)
PM2 / Gunicorn	For managing Python processes robustly

📦 My Recommended Full Stack (Modern, Scalable)
Layer	Tool
Language	Python
Backend	FastAPI + pandas-ta or TA-Lib
Scheduler	APScheduler or Celery
Data Store	PostgreSQL (or SQLite for dev)
Frontend	Streamlit (easy) or React + Dash
Trade Execution	MetaTrader5 Python API / MQL5 EA
Alerts	Telegram Bot, Discord, Email, Webhook
ML Enhancements	scikit-learn, XGBoost (optional)
