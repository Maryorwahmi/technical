ðŸš€ Forex Analyzer Roadmap v4
ðŸ”¹ PHASE 1: CORE SYSTEM DESIGN
Build the foundations â€” data, indicators, signal engine, and filtering.

1. Market Data Pipeline
 Connect to MetaTrader or broker API (e.g., OANDA, FXCM)

 Fetch OHLCV data in M15, H1, H4, D1

 Ensure candle alignment

 Store in local DB (SQLite/Postgres)

2. Indicator Engine
 Calculate EMA, SMA, SuperTrend, Ichimoku

 Add RSI, Stochastic, MACD

 Add ATR, Bollinger Bands

 Map Support/Resistance zones

 Apply across multiple timeframes

3. Signal Generator
 Define multi-timeframe confluence logic

 Program entry rules (e.g., RSI < 30 + bullish engulfing + EMA cross)

 Implement SL/TP logic (ATR-based & structure-based)

 Add risk:reward enforcement (e.g., 1:2+)

 Add confidence scoring per signal

4. Noise Filtering Module
 Filter trades against higher TF trends

 Add ATR volatility threshold

 Implement session filters (avoid low-liquidity times)

 Add correlation filter (prevent conflicting trades)

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 2: AUTOMATION & EXECUTION
Make it actionable â€” connect signals to MetaTrader or alerts.

5. Forecast Module
 Identify setups with non-optimal price

 Track for price to enter optimal zone

 Revalidate structure dynamically

 Trigger trade or alert when valid

6. Backtesting & Optimization
 Connect strategy to Backtrader or other framework

 Include slippage, spread, commissions

 Test across 10+ years of data

 Optimize indicators and SL/TP logic

7. MetaTrader Integration
 Option 1: Use MetaTrader5 Python API

 Option 2: Custom EA + webhook/JSON/Telegram bridge

 Send symbol, entry, SL/TP, direction, confidence

8. Signal Notifications (Optional)
 Integrate Telegram, Discord, Email, Push

 Format message with:

Pair & TF

Entry + SL/TP

Signal strength

Explanation

Optional: chart snapshot

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 3: SMART FILTERING & ADAPTATION
Add intelligence â€” learn from outcomes to improve signal quality.

9. Machine Learning Enhancements (Optional)
 Track performance of each signal type

 Score historical setups (good/bad outcomes)

 Train model to identify high-probability conditions

 Use ML to:

Predict better SL/TP zones

Filter false positives

Rank signals by profitability

 Tools: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 4: PERFORMANCE MONITORING & SCALING
Track, improve, and expand.

10. Analytics Dashboard
 Build dashboard or integrate with existing tools

 Track:

Win rate

Avg risk:reward

Signal frequency

SL/TP stats

Performance per signal type

 Tag & categorize signals for deeper insights

11. Scale to More Pairs/TFs
 Add more symbols (majors, crosses)

 Add weekly (W1) timeframe if needed

 Ensure system performance at scale

 Prioritize execution latency and DB efficiency
