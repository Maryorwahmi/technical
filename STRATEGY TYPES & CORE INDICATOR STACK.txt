üìä 1. My Strategy Types & Core Indicator Stack
Each of my strategies will follow a consistent structure ‚Äî starting with a core set of indicators, then layering in filters and logic tailored to specific market conditions.

Strategy	Ideal Timeframes	Core Indicators	Entry Type
Trend	H1, H4, D1	EMA, SuperTrend, MACD	Pullbacks
Swing	M15, H1	RSI, Stochastic, SMA, Price Action	Reversals
Breakout	M15, H1, H4	Bollinger Bands, ATR, Volume	Momentum Breakouts

‚úÖ 2. My Signal Rules & Logic
üîµ Trend-Following Strategy
Objective: Catch pullbacks within strong, established trends.

Indicators I use:

EMA 20 / 50 / 200

MACD Histogram

SuperTrend

ATR (for SL/TP calculation)

Signal Conditions:

Bullish Setup:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- EMA20 > EMA50 > EMA200 (strong uptrend)
- Price pulls back near EMA20 or EMA50
- MACD histogram is rising
- SuperTrend = bullish
- Bullish candle pattern (pin bar, engulfing, etc.)
- Optional: Price breaks previous swing high (confirmation)
Bearish Setup:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- EMA20 < EMA50 < EMA200 (strong downtrend)
- Price pulls back near EMA20 or EMA50
- MACD histogram falling
- SuperTrend = bearish
- Bearish candlestick pattern
Stop Loss / Take Profit:

SL: Below recent swing low or 1.5x ATR

TP: 2x SL or at next resistance/support zone

üîÅ Swing / Reversal Strategy
Objective: Trade clean reversals from overbought/oversold zones using momentum and structure.

Indicators I use:

RSI (14)

Stochastic (14, 3, 3)

SMA 50

Fractals or key support/resistance

Price action (pin bar, engulfing, etc.)

Signal Conditions:

Buy Setup:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- RSI < 30 (oversold)
- Stochastic crossover below 20
- Price touches or nears support/fractal zone
- Bullish candlestick (e.g., hammer, engulfing)
- SMA50 is flat or upward-sloping
Sell Setup:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- RSI > 70 (overbought)
- Stochastic crossover above 80
- Price near resistance/fractal level
- Bearish candlestick (e.g., shooting star, bearish engulfing)
SL/TP:

SL: Just beyond S/R level or 1.2x ATR

TP: 2x SL or SMA50 retest

üí• Breakout Strategy
Objective: Capture high-momentum breakout moves from consolidation zones.

Indicators I use:

Bollinger Bands

ATR

Volume (or volatility spike)

Price structure (consolidation boxes, triangles)

Signal Conditions:

Buy Breakout:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- Bollinger Bands squeeze (low volatility)
- ATR rising
- Price breaks and closes above upper band
- Volume spike confirms
- Optional: breakout of consolidation box
Sell Breakout:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- Bollinger Bands squeeze
- ATR increasing
- Price closes below lower band
- Volume spike or strong momentum candle
SL/TP:

SL: Inside consolidation box or 1.5x ATR

TP: Use trailing stop or 2‚Äì3x SL

‚öôÔ∏è 3. My Signal Format (JSON Structure)
This is the structure I use when storing or sending signals to MetaTrader or alert systems:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "pair": "EURUSD",
  "strategy": "Trend",
  "timeframe": "H1",
  "direction": "Buy",
  "entry": 1.08750,
  "stop_loss": 1.08520,
  "take_profit": 1.09250,
  "confidence": 92,
  "indicators": {
    "ema": {"20": 1.08630, "50": 1.08400, "200": 1.08000},
    "macd_histogram": 0.0032,
    "supertrend": "bullish",
    "atr": 0.0012
  },
  "signal_time": "2025-08-07 14:30 UTC"
}
üéØ 4. Entry Filters & Quality Control
Before I allow any trade to go live (or trigger alerts), I apply these filters to improve quality:

‚úÖ Confluence Score: Minimum 3‚Äì4 indicators must align

‚úÖ Trend Filter: Confirm higher TF trend supports the trade

‚úÖ ATR Check: Ensure enough volatility is present

‚úÖ Session Filter: Avoid trades during Asian session (unless trading JPY)

‚úÖ Conflict Filter: Avoid trades on correlated pairs at the same time (e.g., EURUSD + GBPUSD)

üß™ 5. Forecasting Ideal Entry (When RR Isn‚Äôt Ready)
Sometimes, a signal setup is valid ‚Äî but the entry price isn‚Äôt ideal yet. In those cases, I log the trade as a ‚Äúpending forecast‚Äù and monitor price for better RR.

yaml
Copy
Edit
Forecast Entry Setup:
  - Signal is valid
  - Entry skipped due to weak R:R
  - Target entry zone: 1.0860
  - Auto-monitor for price to touch zone
  - If price hits & confluence still valid ‚Üí activate trade
